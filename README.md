# Porsmo-Extended
A rust program for pomodoro, timer, stopwatch - all in one.

Fork of [porsmo](https://github.com/ColorCookie-dev/porsmo)

## New/Planned Features
- [x] Estimated time of completion for timers
- [ ] Saveable Sessions
- [ ] Interactively set options
- [ ] Add laps in stopwatch
- [ ] GUI client w/ Tauri? (Lots of work, unlikely)
- [ ] Statistic tracking in JSON
- [ ] Alarms (Timer that accepts absolute time)

Some of these were taken from the [README.md](https://github.com/ColorCookie-dev/porsmo/tree/dev) from the old `dev` branch of porsmo.
I want to try my hand at doing them


# Example
```sh
porsmox
```
