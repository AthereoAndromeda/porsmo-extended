** Someday
- [ ] make the countdown not run longer when it ends
  - Not possible now as the timer won't exit when the it ends
  - it will continue counting excess time
- [ ] Tracking
  - [ ] Tracking pomodoro sessions and resume feature
  - [ ] Tracking timer data in a file
- [ ] reading config for pomodoro timers in a file
** I'll think about it
- Alarm (works like timer, but accepts absolute time rather than a period of time)
- Stopwatch
- Server and GUI client or inbuild gui
